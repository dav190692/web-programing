  <h1>Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h1>

  <h2>to leon werth</h2>

  <p>
    I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating
    it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in
    the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything,
    even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where
    he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not
    enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up
    grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it.
    And so I correct my dedication:
  </p>

  <h2>to leon werth when he was a little boy</h2>

  <hr />

  <ol type="I" id="list">
    <br>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
        called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It
        was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
        Here is a copy of the drawing.
      </p>

      <img src="img/hroznys.jpg" alt="mangust" / class="mangust">

      <p>
        In the book it said: "

        <span class="boa">Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
          After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six
          months that they need for digestion.</span>

        "
      </p>

      <p>
        I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after
        some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first
        drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
      </p>

      <img src="img/klobouk.jpg" alt="hat" />

      <p>
        I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
        drawing frightened them.
      </p>

      <p>
        But they answered:
        <span class="answer">"
          Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa
        constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not
        able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a
        boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it
        clearly. They always need to have
        things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
      </p>

      <img src="img/slon.jpg" alt="elephant" />

      <p>
        The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my
        drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside,
        and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and
        grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have
        been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the
        failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups
        never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for
        children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I
        have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that
        geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish
        China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is
        valuable.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a
        great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence.
        I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them
        intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I
        tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I
        have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of
        true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
      </p>

      <p><span class="hat">"That is a hat."</span></p>

      <p>
        Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or
        primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I
        would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties.
        And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible
        man.
      </p>

      <hr />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to,
        until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six
        years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me
        neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the
        difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for
        me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles
        from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked
        sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my
        amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It
        said:
      </p>

      <span class="many">

        <p>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</p>

        <p>"What!"</p>

        <p>"Draw me a sheep!"</p>
      </span>

      <p>
        I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard.
        I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small
        person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you
        may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But
        my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
      </p>

      <img src="img/malyPrinc.jpg" alt="malyprince" />

      <p>
        That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my
        painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw
        anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting
        out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert
        a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man
        seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be
        fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him
        gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a
        thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to
        speak, I said to him:
      </p>

      <p><span class="question">"But--what are you doing here?"</span></p>

      <p>
        And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a
        matter of great consequence:

      </p>

      <p><span class="draw">"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</span></p>

      <p>
        When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it
        might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in
        danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my
        fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been
        concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told
        the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to
        draw. He answered me:
      </p>

      <p><span class="matter">"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</span></p>

      <p>
        But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two
        pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from
        the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it
        with:
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="no"> "No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa
          constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very
          cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a
          sheep. Draw me a sheep."</span>
      </p>

      <p>So then I made a drawing.</p>

      <img src="img/nemocnyBeranek.jpg" alt="baran1" />

      <p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>

      <p>
        <span class="ship">"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</span>
      </p>

      <p>So I made another drawing.</p>

      <img src="img/Beran.jpg" alt="baran2" />

      <p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently. </p>

      <p>
        <span class="sheep"> "You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a
          ram. It has horns."</span>

      </p>

      <p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>

      <p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>

      <p>

        "This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."

      </p>

      <img src="img/staryBeranek.jpg" alt="baran3" />

      <p>
        By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to
        start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.

      </p>

      <img src="img/krabice.jpg" alt="karobka" />

      <p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>

      <p>
        "This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
      </p>

      <p>
        I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young
        judge:
      </p>

      <p>
        "That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep
        will have to have a great deal of grass?"

      </p>

      <p>"Why?"</p>

      <p>"Because where I live everything is very small..." </p>

      <p>
        "There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very
        small sheep that I have given you."

      </p>

      <p>He bent his head over the drawing.</p>

      <p>"Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep..." </p>

      <p>And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.</p>
